title: What are listeners and how do they work?
---

Listeners are classes that will contain logic, waiting that a given event occurs to execute it. So far we mainly covered
how to make your bot execute logic in response to messages (commands) send by a user. But some use-cases need to execute
code even when no commands have been send. A typical example of the need of a listener is a welcoming message bot : you
need to execute your welcome logic (ie. sending "hello @newMember" somewhere) when the event of a new member joining the
guild occurs, you can't wait for a user to send a command for that. For this example, the event is `GUILD_MEMBER_ADD`
but there is [many more][events-discordjs-doc] that you can "listen" to.
